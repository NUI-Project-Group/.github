# Our first project: MCU Natural User Interface

The MCU Natural User Interface is a Unity-based application that allows users to interact with a virtual environment using sign language gestures for vowels and numbers. The interface utilizes the Leap Motion V2 device to track hand movements, providing real-time feedback through audio and visual cues.
