# About us
We are striving group of IMI students, visiting the course NUI (Natural User Interfaces) of a sibling-program [IKG (Informatik in Kultur und Gesellschaft)](https://ikg.htw-berlin.de/) to create a natural user interface project to show how such project can be used and of worth in society.

## Our first project: MCU Natural User Interface

The MCU Natural User Interface is a Unity-based application that allows users to interact with a virtual environment using sign language gestures for vowels and numbers. The interface utilizes the Leap Motion V2 device to track hand movements, providing real-time feedback through audio and visual cues.
